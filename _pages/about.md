I am currently a dual major student at [UMASS Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), pursuing a Ph.D. in [Civil Engineering](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/civil-and-environmental-engineering) and an M.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). My Ph.D. thesis centers on the application of Machine Learning to predict the optimal timing for railway maintenance using large datasets. My research extends to the field of NLP, particularly investigating the memorization capacity of LLMs and their robustness towards entity replacement within an in-context learning setup.
